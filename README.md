# Minecraft Server Manager
This project has the goal of managing multiple instances of Minecraft servers in an autonomous and efficient way 

## What is the logic?
The logic of the project is to have a main server that will be responsible for managing the other servers, which will be called "slave servers". The main server will be responsible for creating, starting, stopping and deleting servers, as well as managing the resources of each server.

## Features
